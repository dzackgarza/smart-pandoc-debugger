## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Approach
1. **Start simple, then refine**
   - Begin with the simplest implementation that works
   - Refine and optimize based on testing
   - Add complexity only when necessary

2. **Test-driven development**
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Ensure all code is covered by tests
   - Use tests to verify behavior

3. **Incremental delivery**
   - Deliver working functionality in small increments
   - Get feedback early and often
   - Adjust plans based on feedback

### Quality Assurance
1. **Code quality**
   - Follow consistent coding standards
   - Use type hints and docstrings
   - Perform code reviews

2. **Testing strategy**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows

3. **Documentation**
   - Document code as it's written
   - Keep documentation in sync with code
   - Create user-facing documentation
