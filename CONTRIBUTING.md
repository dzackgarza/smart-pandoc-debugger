# Contributing to Smart Pandoc Debugger

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Smart Pandoc Debugger! This document outlines the process for contributing to the project.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Setup

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-pandoc-debugger.git
   cd smart-pandoc-debugger
   ```
3. Set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-branch-name
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features or improvements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `test/` - Test additions or improvements
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

### 3. Make Changes

1. Make your code changes following the project's coding standards
2. Add tests for new functionality with proper assertions
3. Run tests locally:
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=./src pytest tests/ -v
   ```
4. The project includes a pre-commit hook that will:
   - Run tests automatically
   - Check for untracked files and potential issues
   - Remind you of important checks before committing

### 4. Repository Cleanliness

Before committing, ensure:

- üßπ Remove all temporary and debug files
- üìÇ Organize test/debug files in appropriate directories
- üö´ Never commit sensitive information (API keys, credentials, etc.)
- üìè Avoid committing large files (>5MB). Use git-lfs if necessary
- üîç Review all changes with `git diff --cached` before committing

Common files/directories to exclude (add to `.gitignore` if needed):
- `*.pyc`, `__pycache__/`, `*.swp`, `*.swo`
- Virtual environments: `venv/`, `.venv/`, `env/`
- Build artifacts: `dist/`, `build/`, `*.egg-info/`
- Local configuration files
- Log files and databases

### 5. Commit Your Changes

1. Review your changes:
   ```bash
   git status
   git diff --cached
   ```

2. Stage your changes:
   ```bash
   # Stage specific files
   git add <changed-files>
   
   # Or stage all changes
   # git add .
   ```

3. Commit with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(scope): Add new feature"
   ```
   
   #### Commit Message Format:
   ```
   type(scope): description
   
   Detailed description if needed
   
   - Bullet points for important changes
   - Reference issues with #123
   ```
   
   ##### Types:
   - `feat`: New feature
   - `fix`: Bug fix
   - `docs`: Documentation changes
   - `style`: Code style changes
   - `refactor`: Code refactoring
   - `test`: Test related changes
   - `chore`: Maintenance tasks
   
   ##### Scope Examples:
   - `feat(api)`: API-related feature
   - `fix(cli)`: CLI-related bug fix
   - `docs(readme)`: README updates

### 6. Push Changes to Remote

1. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   # First push to a new branch
   git push -u origin feature/descriptive-branch-name
   
   # Subsequent pushes
   # git push
   ```
   
   **Important**: 
   - You must be the one to push changes to the remote repository.
   - The automated assistant can help with local changes but will not push to remote.
   - Ensure all tests pass before pushing.

### 7. Create a Pull Request

1. Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository using the GitHub CLI:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "feat(scope): Your descriptive title" --body """
   ## üéØ [Brief Description of Changes]
   
   [Detailed description of what this PR does and why it's needed]
   
   ### ‚úÖ Features Implemented
   - [ ] Feature 1
   - [ ] Feature 2
   
   ### üß™ Testing
   - [ ] All tests pass
   - [ ] New tests added for new features
   - [ ] Test coverage maintained or improved
   
   ### üìù Documentation
   - [ ] Code is well-documented
   - [ ] README/CHANGELOG updated if needed
   - [ ] Project documentation (roadmap, etc.) updated to reflect completed work
   """ --web
   ```
   
   Or create the PR through the GitHub web interface.

2. Update the project documentation to mark your branch as completed in the roadmap or relevant documentation
3. Ensure your PR includes:

   ```markdown
   ## üéØ [Brief Description of Changes]
   
   [Detailed description of what this PR does and why it's needed]
   
   ### ‚úÖ Features Implemented
   - Feature 1
   - Feature 2
   
   ### üß™ Testing
   - [ ] All tests pass
   - [ ] New tests added for new features
   - [ ] Test coverage maintained or improved
   
   ### üìù Documentation
   - [ ] Code is well-documented
   - [ ] README/CHANGELOG updated if needed
   - [ ] Project documentation (roadmap, etc.) updated to reflect completed work
   ```

4. After creating the PR, get the automated Copilot review by running:
   ```bash
   # View all PR comments and reviews
   gh pr view --json comments,reviews --jq '.reviews[] | {body, comments: .comments[].body, path: .comments[].path, line: .comments[].line}'
   ```
   
   This will display the automated review from Copilot. You must:
   - Address all points raised in the review
   - Make necessary changes locally
   - Push the updates to your branch
   - The PR will only be accepted once all review comments are resolved
   
5. Check for any CI/CD failures and fix them before requesting review
6. Request review from maintainers after addressing all automated review comments

## Pre-commit Hook

The project includes a pre-commit hook that will:
- Run tests automatically
- Check for untracked files and potential issues
- Remind you of important checks before committing

To install the pre-commit hook (if not already installed):
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

The hook will help ensure code quality by catching common issues before they're committed.

4. Request review from maintainers after addressing all automated review comments

## Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Keep lines under 100 characters
- Include docstrings for all public functions and classes

## Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Run tests before pushing code
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested

## Review Process

1. All PRs require at least one approval
2. To view all reviewer and Copilot comments, including those on specific lines of code, use:
   ```bash
   # View all PR comments and reviews
   gh pr view 11 --json comments,reviews --jq '.reviews[] | {body, comments: .comments[].body, path: .comments[].path, line: .comments[].line}'
   
   # Or view comments in the GitHub web interface at:
   # https://github.com/your-username/smart-pandoc-debugger/pull/PR_NUMBER
   ```
3. Address all review comments
4. Update the PR with any requested changes
5. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Reporting Issues

When reporting issues, please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)
