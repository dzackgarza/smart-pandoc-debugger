## Branch 4: Cross-Reference Validation
- [ ] When `\ref{label}` is used, verify `\label{label}` exists
- [ ] Check for duplicate `\label` definitions
- [ ] Verify all figures/tables have labels if referenced
- [ ] Check for references to non-existent sections/equations/figures
- [ ] Detect forward references that might cause compilation issues
- [ ] Check for references to labels defined in conditional blocks

- [ ] Detect when `\label` is used inside a group that might affect its scope
- [ ] Check for duplicate labels across included files

## Branch 5: Bibliography and Citation Validation
- [ ] When `\cite{key}` is used, verify `key` exists in bibliography
- [ ] Check for duplicate citation keys in bibliography
- [ ] Verify bibliography style file exists if specified
- [ ] Check for malformed `.bib` entries that could cause compilation failures
