# Smart Pandoc Debugger - Version 2.0.0 (PDF-FOCUSED)

## Critical File Validation
- [ ] When `\input{}` or `\include{}` is used, verify file exists and is readable
- [ ] Check for circular includes that could cause infinite loops
- [ ] Verify all required image files exist at specified paths
- [ ] Check for missing or unreadable bibliography files
- [ ] Validate that required packages are installed and available

## Essential Math Validation
- [ ] For `\begin{align}...\end{align}`, ensure:
  - Matching number of `&` alignment characters per row
  - Proper use of `\\` for line breaks
  - All environments are properly closed
- [ ] In matrices and arrays, verify consistent column count:
  ```
  \begin{pmatrix}
  a & b \\
  c & d & e  % Error: Column count mismatch
  \end{pmatrix}
  ```
- [ ] Check for unpaired `\left`/`\right` delimiters in equations
- [ ] Verify all math environments are properly closed

## Basic Table Validation
- [ ] Ensure all tables have consistent column counts
- [ ] Check for unescaped `&` and `\\` in table cells
- [ ] Verify all `\begin{tabular}` have matching `\end{tabular}`
- [ ] Check for missing `\hline` or `\toprule`/`\bottomrule` in tables

## Essential Bibliography Checks
- [ ] When `\cite{key}` is used, verify `key` exists in bibliography
- [ ] Check for duplicate citation keys in bibliography
- [ ] Verify bibliography style file exists if specified
- [ ] Check for malformed `.bib` entries that could cause compilation failures

## Critical Cross-Reference Validation
- [ ] When `\ref{label}` is used, verify `\label{label}` exists
- [ ] Check for duplicate `\label` definitions
- [ ] Verify all figures/tables have labels if referenced
- [ ] Check for references to non-existent sections/equations/figures

## Essential Code Block Validation
- [ ] Verify all code blocks are properly closed
- [ ] Check for unescaped special characters in code blocks
- [ ] Ensure language specifiers are valid for syntax highlighting
- [ ] Verify indentation is consistent within code blocks

## Critical Equation Validation
- [ ] Check for unclosed math delimiters (`$...$`, `\(...\)`)
- [ ] Verify all `\begin{equation}` have matching `\end{equation}`
- [ ] Check for common LaTeX math errors that prevent compilation:
  ```
  \frac{1}{2  % Missing closing brace
  x^\frac{1}{2}  % Should be x^{\frac{1}{2}}
  ```
- [ ] Verify all math mode commands are valid

## Advanced LaTeX Gotchas

### Cross-Reference Complexities
- [ ] Detect forward references that might cause compilation issues
- [ ] Check for references to labels defined in conditional blocks
- [ ] Verify that `\ref` and `\pageref` point to the right label types
- [ ] Detect when `\label` is used inside a group that might affect its scope
- [ ] Check for duplicate labels across included files

### Math Mode Intricacies
- [ ] Detect when `\left.` or `\right.` is used without matching partner
- [ ] Check for `\left`/`\right` across line breaks in equations
- [ ] Verify that `\substack` has matching number of `&` in each row
- [ ] Detect when `\intertext` is used outside display math mode
- [ ] Check for `\tag` usage that might conflict with equation numbering

### Table and Figure Nuances
- [ ] Detect when `\caption` is placed after `\label` in floats
- [ ] Check for `\label` outside `\caption` in `subfigure`/`subtable`
- [ ] Verify that `\multicolumn` spans the correct number of columns
- [ ] Detect when `\addlinespace` is used without `booktabs`
- [ ] Check for `\bottomrule` before `\end{table}` in `threeparttable`

### Package-Specific Pitfalls
- [ ] Detect when `\si` is used without `siunitx` package
- [ ] Check for `\DeclareMathOperator` in document body instead of preamble
- [ ] Verify that `\includepdf` has correct page ranges
- [ ] Detect when `\autoref` is used without `hyperref`
- [ ] Check for `\cellcolor` without `[table]xcolor` option

### Advanced Environment Issues
- [ ] Detect when `\item` is used outside list environments
- [ ] Check for `\begin{enumerate}` without `[label=]` when needed
- [ ] Verify that `\newenvironment` has matching begin/end definitions
- [ ] Detect when `\begin{proof}` is used without `amsthm`
- [ ] Check for `\begin{theorem}` without proper theorem environment definition

### Bibliography and Citation Complexities
- [ ] Detect when `\cite` is used in section headings without proper protection
- [ ] Check for `\citeauthor`/`\citeyear` used without `\citet`/`\citep`
- [ ] Verify that `\nocite` is used before `\bibliography`
- [ ] Detect when `\bibliographystyle` is missing or incorrect
- [ ] Check for inconsistent use of `\textcite` vs `\citet`

### Advanced Math Typesetting
- [ ] Detect when `\ensuremath` is used unnecessarily
- [ ] Check for inconsistent use of `\mathrm`, `\mathbf`, `\mathsf`
- [ ] Verify that `\DeclareMathOperator` is used for custom operators
- [ ] Detect when `\left.` or `\right.` could be replaced with fixed sizes
- [ ] Check for `\left\{` without proper scaling in display math

### Cross-Document Issues
- [ ] Detect when `\input` or `\include` creates circular dependencies
- [ ] Check for duplicate label names across included files
- [ ] Verify that all required files exist in the same directory or TEXINPUTS
- [ ] Detect when `\graphicspath` is needed but missing
- [ ] Check for inconsistent use of relative vs. absolute paths in `\includegraphics`

## Critical Error Reporting
- [ ] Provide clear error messages with file and line numbers
- [ ] Show context around errors (3 lines before/after)
- [ ] Suggest common fixes for known error patterns
