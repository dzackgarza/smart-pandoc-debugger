## Branch 1: Basic Text & Character Validation
**Files likely touched:** `markdown_proofer_team/`, `tex_proofer_team/`
**Dependencies:** None (foundation branch)

- [ ] When special LaTeX characters (`&`, `%`, `#`, `_`, `^`, `~`, `\`) appear in text without proper escaping, suggest escaping with `\`
- [ ] When document contains non-ASCII characters that commonly cause issues (e.g., smart quotes), suggest replacements
- [ ] When URL or email is malformed (e.g., `user@domain` without TLD), flag as potentially problematic
- [ ] Flag Markdown syntax that doesn't match CommonMark spec (e.g., inconsistent list markers)
- [ ] Detect and fix unescaped special characters in text:
  - `&` ‚Üí `\&` in tables
  - `%` ‚Üí `\%` in text
  - `#` ‚Üí `\#` in text
  - `_` ‚Üí `\_` in text
  - `^` ‚Üí `\^` in text

- [ ] In math mode, flag common errors like `\frac{1}{2` (unclosed brace) or `x^23` (missing braces)
- [ ] For `\begin{align}...\end{align}`, verify:
  - Each `&` alignment character has matching `&` on same line
  - Each line ends with `\\`
  - No empty lines inside environment
- [ ] In math mode, flag common errors like `\sinx` (should be `\sin x`) or `\left(` without `\right)`

- [ ] Catch environment issues:
  ```
  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics{image}
    \caption{My image}  % Missing \label
  \end{figure}
  % Later: \ref{fig:image}  % Undefined reference
  ```
- [ ] Check for missing packages:
  - `\usepackage{amsmath}` for `\text`, `\DeclareMathOperator`
  - `\usepackage{graphicx}` for `\includegraphics`
  - `\usepackage{hyperref}` for `\url`, `\href`

## Branch 4: Code Block & Structure Validation
**Files likely touched:** `check_markdown_unclosed_envs.py`, new structure validation modules  
**Dependencies:** None (independent parsing)

- [ ] For triple-backtick code blocks, ensure there's a matching set of backticks to close it
- [ ] When code block uses 4-space indentation, ensure all lines in block are indented consistently
- [ ] For nested code blocks (e.g., markdown in HTML in markdown), properly parse and validate each level
- [ ] When code block starts with ` ```language `, verify language is supported by syntax highlighter
- [ ] For indented code blocks, ensure consistent indentation (spaces only or tabs only, not mixed)
- [ ] When heading level jumps (e.g., `##` to `####` without `###` in between), suggest fixing hierarchy
- [ ] For lists, ensure consistent bullet/numbering style and indentation
- [ ] In tables, ensure all rows have same number of columns and proper alignment
- [ ] For `![alt](path.png)`, verify image file exists at specified path
- [ ] When section contains only whitespace or comments, suggest removing or adding content
- [ ] When paragraph exceeds 80 characters (configurable), suggest breaking into multiple paragraphs
- [ ] Find problematic whitespace:
  - Multiple spaces (except in verbatim)
  - Tabs used for alignment
  - Inconsistent line endings
  - Trailing whitespace

## Branch 5: References & Cross-References
**Files likely touched:** New reference validation modules, potentially `Oracle.py` for suggestions

  - Missing `\bibliography{refs}`
  - `\citep` vs `\citet` misuse

## Branch 7: Table & Layout Validation
**Files likely touched:** New table validation modules, extend existing table checkers

**Dependencies:** All other branches (final integration branch)

- [ ] For each error, include:
  - File name and line number
  - Snippet of problematic code
  - Clear explanation of issue
  - Suggested fix when possible
- [ ] For common errors, provide one-command fixes (e.g., "Add closing $")
- [ ] For complex issues, link to relevant documentation with more details
- [ ] Group related errors (e.g., all math mode errors) when they're likely related

## Branch 10: Testing & Quality Assurance
**Files likely touched:** `tests/` directory, test data files
**Dependencies:** All feature branches (validates everything works together)

- [ ] 100% test coverage for all error detection code paths
- [ ] Test suite includes real documents from common Pandoc/LaTeX workflows

## Development Notes

### Branch Merge Order Recommendation:
1. **Foundation branches first:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 (can be developed in parallel)
2. **Dependent branches:** 5 (after 3), 7 (after 1)  
3. **Integration branches:** 9 (after all feature branches), 10 (final validation)

### Merge Conflict Mitigation:
- Each branch touches different core files/modules
- Shared utilities (`data_model.py`, `manager_runner.py`) should only be extended, not modified
- New functionality should be additive (new classes/functions) rather than modifying existing ones
- Test files are organized by branch to avoid conflicts
