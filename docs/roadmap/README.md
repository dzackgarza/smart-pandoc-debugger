# Development Roadmap

This directory contains the development roadmap for the Smart Pandoc Debugger project, organized by version milestones.

## Version Files

- `V0.0.md` - **CURRENT VERSION** - Core MVP functionality
- `V1.0.md` - **PLANNED** - Next set of features
- `V2.0.md` - **FUTURE** - Advanced features and integrations
- `V99.md` - **LUXURY** - Nice-to-have features and enhancements

## Purpose

Each version file contains a checklist of features, improvements, and tests that need to be completed for that version. The format is intentionally minimal to focus on actionable items.

## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible functionality
- **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes
